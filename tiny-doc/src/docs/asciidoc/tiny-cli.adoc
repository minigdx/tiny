To run the tiny serve command, you can use the following examples:

```bash
tiny-cli serve myGame.zip

```bash
tiny-cli serve MyGame.zip --port 8081
```

This will launch the local web server on port number `8081` and serve the game located in the `MyGame.zip` file.

Once the server is running, you can access the game in your web browser by navigating to the URL `http://localhost:[port number]/`. For example, if you used the default port number, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your web browser to access the game.

NOTE: The tiny serve command is intended for local testing only and should not be used to serve your game online. When you are ready to publish your game, you should upload the exported game files to a web server and serve them from there.
