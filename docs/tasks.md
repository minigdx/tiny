# Tiny Game Engine Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Tiny Game Engine project. Tasks are organized by category and include both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

[ ] Refactor the GameEngine class to reduce its size and responsibilities (currently 697 lines)
[ ] Create a more formalized event system for communication between engine components
[ ] Implement a dependency injection system to reduce tight coupling between components
[ ] Develop a more robust asset management system with caching and preloading capabilities
[ ] Create a unified error handling and reporting system across the engine
[ ] Implement a configuration system that allows for more granular control of engine features
[ ] Design a more flexible rendering pipeline that can be customized for different platforms

## Code Quality Improvements

[ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for core engine components
[ ] Implement integration tests for the Lua scripting system
[ ] Add code documentation to all public APIs
[ ] Refactor the RunCommand.kt file to extract the debugging server setup into a separate class
[ ] Fix the TODO in RunCommand.kt line 105 regarding frame content handling
[ ] Fix the TODO in RunCommand.kt line 48 regarding jpackage option
[ ] Implement proper error handling for WebSocket communication in the debugging system
[ ] Add null safety checks throughout the codebase
[ ] Standardize naming conventions across the project
[ ] Reduce code duplication in resource handling

## Performance Improvements

[ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created and destroyed objects
[ ] Optimize the rendering pipeline to reduce draw calls
[ ] Implement batching for sprite rendering
[ ] Add support for texture atlases to reduce texture switching
[ ] Optimize Lua script execution with caching of compiled scripts
[ ] Implement lazy loading of resources
[ ] Profile and optimize memory usage during gameplay
[ ] Implement multi-threading for resource loading and processing
[x] Optimize the sound system for lower latency

## Feature Enhancements

[ ] Add support for additional platforms (mobile, console)

[ ] Document the engine architecture and design decisions
[ ] Create diagrams illustrating the engine's component relationships
[ ] Document the build and release process
[ ] Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
[ ] Document performance best practices
[ ] Create a migration guide for upgrading between engine versions
[ ] Improve inline code comments for better maintainability

## Build and Deployment Improvements

[ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing
[ ] Implement automated release management
[ ] Create a more streamlined installation process
[ ] Implement versioned documentation that matches each release
[ ] Add support for package managers for easier installation
[ ] Implement automated performance benchmarking
[ ] Create a more robust build system for cross-platform compilation
[ ] Implement code quality checks in the build process
[ ] Add support for custom build configurations
